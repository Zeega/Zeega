Dear {{username}},

We’re very happy to let you play around with Zeega!

There are bugs and new features in development, but we really wanted to get this in people’s hands early. If you encounter issues, please let us know, as we love to know what’s working and what’s not!

Right now, our HTML5 editor works best in Chrome/Safari. 

And for more info on getting started, see these tutorials and FAQ:
